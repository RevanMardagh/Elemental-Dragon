Meaning, if you buy another base skill, not only is that the last one you can buy, but you also keep the skills of your previous element.\n2. If you get light dragon as a secondary or primary element, you are a herbavore, no matter what. No element can override that. Meaning, that if you are light element AT ALL, you §f§lCANNOT§r eat meat."
