# What is the dragon origin?

The dragon origin is my attempt at trying to break the limits of what an origin can actually be, I mean there are evolving origins and some origins that can up, but there's no real **choice** in those. The only choosing you get to do is choosing to play them, which can be a real problem if you want to switch mid-way and there's no orbs, or if you like the *idea* of the origin but just dont like the *powers*. This solves that by putting the making of the origin into your hands. It does this by giving you the ability to make the origin as you play.
